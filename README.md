# Machine learning and modelling work

This repository contains selected machine learning and statistical modelling assignments completed by  
Dr Abdul Basit (WHO Epidemiologist, seconded to the Federal Directorate of Immunization, Pakistan).

The code focuses on:
- Supervised learning (classification and regression)
- Model evaluation (ROC curves, cross-validation, calibration)
- Applications to infectious disease and immunisation data where possible

The repository is shared as supporting evidence of quantitative and coding skills for the  
SACEMA Policy Modelling Fellowship 2026.

## Contents

- `ML_Code_Final.R` – main R script for the assignment
- `Environment_Files_Final.RData` – saved R environment with data/objects
- `ML_Presentation.pptx` – slides summarising methods and results
